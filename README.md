1- First select the car you want and the potential max buyout
2- Make sure to focus the FH5 window when the countdown starts
3- Second monitor highly recommended because when you want to
   close the script you have to just force close the window
   (Put the game in windowed mode and put the script over it if you don't have a second monitor)
4- It will start counting down from 5 once you start the script.
   'y' = yes, 'n' = no
