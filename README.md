                    -FH5-Sniping-Script-

A simple FH5 sniping cript for people who are lazy
1- First select the car you want and the potential max buyout
2- Make sure to focus the FH5 window when the countdown starts
3- Second monitor highly recommended because when you want to
   close the script you have to just force close the window
   (Put the game in windowed mode and put the script over it if you don't have a second monitor)
4- It will start counting down from 5 once you start the script.
   'y' = yes, 'n' = no
   Restart every time you snipe a car or when buyout fails
   If you don't have python installed and setup run the .exe
   If you have python setup but don't have the keyboard library 
   open cmd and enter: pip install keyboard (Only if you want to run the .py version)
